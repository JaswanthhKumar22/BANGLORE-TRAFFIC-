🚦 Bangalore Traffic Prediction System

The Bangalore Traffic Prediction System is a machine learning–based project designed to predict traffic conditions across different areas of Bengaluru using historical traffic and environmental data.

The system analyzes multiple real-world factors such as traffic volume, congestion levels, weather conditions, and road utilization to determine whether a specific location is likely to experience traffic or smooth flow.

🎯 Project Objective

To develop an intelligent traffic prediction model that helps:

Commuters plan travel efficiently

Authorities analyze congestion trends

Improve urban traffic management decisions

📊 Dataset Features

The model uses a comprehensive dataset containing:

Date

Area Name

Road/Intersection Name
