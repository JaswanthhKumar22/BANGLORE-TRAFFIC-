# 🚦 Bangalore Traffic Prediction System

A Machine Learning–based traffic prediction project designed to analyze and forecast traffic conditions across different areas of Bengaluru using historical traffic, environmental, and congestion data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Bangalore Traffic Prediction System aims to build an intelligent model that predicts whether traffic is likely to occur in a given area based on multiple real-world factors such as traffic volume, weather conditions, road utilization, and congestion levels.

This system can help commuters, urban planners, and authorities make data-driven decisions for better traffic management.
